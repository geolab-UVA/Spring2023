Welcome to the Spring 2023 edition of GeometryLab @ UVA.

## Crochet

Visualizing hyperbolic space is difficult; for this we use models. But can we create a model in practice. If you crochet in a specific pattern you can! Let us explore 
how and why.

## Rendering visualizing geometries 

Many 3d rendering engines for games and animation are focused on our usual Euclidean reality. Can one use the tools available to help visualize non Euclidean geometries. We are out to understand how visualization and rendering works and how we can adapt it to more exciting and exotic settings.
